## Investigation of the differences between closed-canopy forested wetlands and uplands in the PNW

Soil saturation and inundation are key characteristics of wetlands and can promote the accumulation of soil organic carbon
while inhibiting plant productivity. However, some forested wetlands can maintain high productivity, exhibiting thick closed canopies
which attain significant aboveground biomass such that they are indistinguishable from the surrounding upland forest. These 
closed-canopy forested wetlands (CCFW) may appear similar to forested uplands but soil saturation and inundation may alter 
patterns of tree growth (leaf-stem ratio?, thick crowns?) through repeated stress events. This potential change in forest structure development
may provide unique forest structure that can serve as important habitat niches. 


Two questions need to be addressed:
1. Is the forest structure of closed-canopy forested wetlands similar to upland forests?
2. Do closed canopy forested wetlands contain similar aboveground biomass compared to upland forests?
